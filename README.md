**Link to Project:** https://jbisquick.github.io/odin-restaurant-page/

# How it's Made:

**Tech Used:** CSS, JavaScript, npm, and Webpack.

The pages were created using JavaScript DOM manipulation. NPM and Webpack were used to bundle the files together.

# Lesson's Learned:

This project was designed to teach me how to use ES6 Modules, npm, and webpack. Using ES6 modules, I was able to break up the code into multiple cleaner JavaScript files. I learned how to link different types of files together, including images, JavaScript, CSS, and fonts. I acquired the ability to use npm to download plugins, libraries, and tools. I gained knowledge on how to bundle these files using Webpack.
